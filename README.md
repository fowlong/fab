# PDF Editor (MVP scaffold)

This repository contains the initial scaffolding for a browser-based PDF editor
powered by Fabric.js and pdf.js on the frontend with a Rust (axum) backend. The
project is organised under `pdf-editor/` with separate frontend and backend
workspaces plus shared schemas and end-to-end fixtures.

See `pdf-editor/README.md` for full details on the project layout, the current
feature set, and instructions for running the developer stack.
