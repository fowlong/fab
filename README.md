# PDF Content Stream Editor

This repository hosts a proof-of-concept PDF editor that pairs a Fabric.js interaction layer with a pdf.js rendered preview and a Rust backend that rewrites PDF content streams incrementally.

The implementation lives in [`pdf-editor/`](pdf-editor/). Refer to the package-specific READMEs for setup instructions.
