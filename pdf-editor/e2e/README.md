# End-to-end assets

This directory contains supporting files for manual and automated end-to-end
checks. Add PDFs that are safe to share for testing purposes. A placeholder
`tests.http` file compatible with the VS Code REST Client extension is included
for quick manual verification once the backend endpoints are fully implemented.
