# Frontend

A Vite + TypeScript single-page application that renders PDFs with pdf.js and overlays Fabric.js controllers for editing operations.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the development server on <http://localhost:5173>.
- `npm run build` — type-check and build the production bundle.
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally.

Set the `VITE_API_BASE` environment variable to point to the backend server when needed.
