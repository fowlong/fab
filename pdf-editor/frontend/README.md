# Frontend

This directory contains the Vite/TypeScript application that renders the PDF preview via `pdf.js` and overlays Fabric.js controllers for editing.

## Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE` to override the backend URL if it is not running on `http://localhost:8787`.
