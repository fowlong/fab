# Backend

Axum-based JSON API that stores uploaded PDFs, returns a lightweight IR, and accepts patch operations. The current implementation focuses on scaffolding and returns the stored PDF without modification.

## Running

```bash
cd backend
cargo run
```

The server listens on <http://localhost:8787>.
