# PDF Editor

A proof-of-concept browser-based PDF editor that combines a Fabric.js overlay with a pdf.js underlay and a Rust backend powered by Axum and lopdf. The project demonstrates how to perform structural PDF edits (transforms, text edits, opacity changes) while keeping the PDF vector content intact.
